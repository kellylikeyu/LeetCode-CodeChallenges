(This question is a variation of the LeetCode question 692. Top K Frequent Words. If you haven't completed that question yet, it is recommended to solve it first.)
You are given an array of messages where each element is a triplet: [<sender>, <receiver>, <message>]. For each sender-receiver pair, if the sender sends multiple messages to the same receiver, they are considered duplicates (spam).

function findSpamMessages(messages) {
    const pairCount = new Map();
    const spammers = new Set();

    for (const [sender, receiver] of messages) {
        const key = `${sender}->${receiver}`;
        const count = (pairCount.get(key) || 0) + 1;
        pairCount.set(key, count);

        if (count > 1) {
            spammers.add(key);
        }
    }

    return Array.from(spammers);
}
